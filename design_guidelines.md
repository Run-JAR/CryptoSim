# Cryptocurrency Mining Simulator - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Hybrid Approach**: Combining crypto dashboard aesthetics (Binance, Coinbase) with gaming UI elements for an engaging, data-rich mining simulation experience.

**Core Philosophy**: Create a futuristic, tech-forward interface that balances real-time data visualization with gaming excitement. The design should feel like a professional crypto mining operation while maintaining playful engagement.
